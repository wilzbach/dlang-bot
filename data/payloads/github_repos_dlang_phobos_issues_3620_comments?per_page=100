I don't know of any reasoning that would have gone into allowing that. The main issue is that parameter names of course aren't proper parts of the type system. Two functions with identical signature but different parameter names have the same type. Parameter names aren't part of the mangle string. Thus, you can run into inconsistencies where two types are seemingly different (e.g. looking at `.stringof`), but are in fact considered to be the same by language and compiler.\r\n\r\nSince parameter names aren't part of the type (as in, relevant to the type system), the only way to resolve these inconsistencies without relying on DMD implementation internals seems to be to make sure they don't ever leak into the type in the first place."
